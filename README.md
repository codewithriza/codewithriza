I've been interested in coding since the age of 10 years old. I started off with block-based Scratch code and grew to learn line languages such as Python and Java. At 12, I used my Java knowledge to experiment with Minecraft plugins and started to create my own web design using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At around 13, I started to try creating my own games in Unity, where I dipped my toes into C#. When I was 14, I delved into projects involving hardware and libraries such as TensorFlow, Raspberry Pi, NumPy, Ultralytics, Flask, Pandas, SQL, SDL2, Jetson Nano, and Keras. Currently, I am playing around with bot development & web design, including projects involving OpenCV. I have tried tools such as Node.js and React, however, I am still learning!
